Based on the error messages, we've identified the following issues:

1. Error on line 2574:
   Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for 'CardContent'.
   
   This indicates there's a <CardContent> tag that was opened but not properly closed.

2. Error on line 2575:
   Unexpected token. Did you mean `{'}'}` or `&rbrace;`?
   
   This suggests there might be a syntax error with braces.

3. Error on line 3050:
   Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for 'Card'.
   
   There's a <Card> tag that was opened but not properly closed.

4. Error on line 3165:
   Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for 'div'.
   
   A <div> tag was opened but not properly closed.

5. Error on line 3166:
   ')' expected.
   
   A closing parenthesis is missing.

6. Error on line 3167:
   Expression expected.
   
   There's an issue with an expression syntax.

7. Error on line 3166:
   Cannot find name 'div'.
   
   This suggests a syntax issue with a div tag.

Typical JSX structure should look like:

<Card>
  <CardHeader>...</CardHeader>
  <CardContent>...</CardContent>
  <CardFooter>...</CardFooter>
</Card>

The fix should ensure that all opening tags have their corresponding closing tags,
and that all JSX expressions are properly formatted.
